This is going to contain links to all of my various projects.\r\n\r\n## About Me\r\n\r\nI am an IT infrastructure and business process consultant with over ten years of experience supporting various government and commercial clients.  In addition I have acted as a technical advisor for multiple startup companies.\r\n\r\nI am interested in cutting edge technologies, not only in traditional Information Technology disciplines, but also in other areas such as social networking, crowdsourcing, and wireless communications.  As a result, my expertise spans a wide range of areas ranging from cloud computing and IT virtualization solutions, to technical analysis and resolution of \"hard science\"â€‹ problems for various clients.\r\n\r\nI have also contributed to the open source community.  I authored a native Node.js module for interacting with VMware vCenter/ESXi hosts via the vSphere WS API and SOAP.  I also assisted in adding MariaDB support to Sequelize, a Node.JS based ORM.  I've also provided bugfixes to other Node.js modules such as hapi-good (part of the core Hapi framework) and node-soap.  I have also contributed to other open source projects written in other languages such as Python.\r\n\r\nI have a broad technical knowledge base and keep up to date in a variety of areas.  I also learn new technologies and languages quickly and with ease.\r\n\r\n_[(From LinkedIn)](http://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcorrea)_\r\n\r\n## Project List\r\n\r\n### Node.js modules/libs contributed to\r\n\r\n* [hapijs/good-file](http://github.com/hapijs/good-file)\r\n* [vpulim/node-soap](http://github.com/vpulim/node-soap)\r\n* [sequelize/sequelize](http://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)\r\n\r\n### My own projects\r\n\r\n* [node-vsphere](http://github.com/reedog117/node-vsphere)\r\n* [pi-overwatch](http://github.com/reedog117/pi-overwatch)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nWant to get a hold of me?
